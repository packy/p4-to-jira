# this is a sample configuration file for p4-to-jira

# the following three parameters are REQUIRED. They must be either
# specified in a config file or on the command line, or the script
# will terminiate with an error.

p4_project    //depot/trunk/...
jira_project  JRA
jira_url      https://jira.atlassian.com/

# if any of the following parameters are omitted, a default value is used

jira_username  # if not specified, script will look in $HOME/.netrc file
jira_password  # if not specified, script will look in $HOME/.netrc file

ssl_verify_none  1 # allow self-signed certs for JIRA server (default)

# if the environment of the user running this sctipt does not have
# the variables P4PORT, P4USER, P4PASSWD, this file will be
# used to define them
p4_identity /path/to/.p4-identity

# if you are using Code Collaborator, you can specify a URL to make
# the text "Review: ID nnnnn" into a hyperlink.  The URL will be passed
# through sprintf with the numeric review ID as the only parameter.
# Any instances of # will be converted to # as well.
#
# leaving this parameter blank will disable making review IDs into hyperlinks.

ccollab_url  http://p4collab.smartbear.com:8484/ui#review:id=%d

# file used to store last change ID examined
last_change_file [% base_dir %]/var/last_change.txt

# you can set the value of the last change ID examined with the 'last_change'
# parameter; this will take precedence over anything stored in the file
# indicated by 'last_change_file' and p4-to-jira will never
# update this value.
#
# last_change 12345

# The maximum length the differences for a change can have before they're
# written to a file and attached to the issue rather than included in the text
# of the comment itself.
max_diff_len = 4K

# These two parameters determine where the log file will be written.
# The log_name_pattern is passed through POSIX::strftime() with the
# current local time to produce the actual log file name.
log_dir          [% base_dir %]/log
log_name_pattern p4-to-jira_%Y-%m-%d.log

# The timestamp at the beginning of each line of the logfile,
# formatted for POSIX::strftime()
log_timestamp    %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S

# setting the 'fake' parameter to 1 enables 'Fake mode'. This is used for
# testing and debugging.  The program runs, but does not update the
# last_change_file and does not create any comments on the JIRA issues it
# finds. Because it doesn't create the comments, the text of what would
# have been the comments are written to the log/stdout.

# Verbosity for testing and debugging.  Increases the amount of information

#   verbose 0 (default)
#
#     Default verbosity.  Logs when comments are being made to JIRA
#     issues for changes, but not the text of the comment (unless --fake
#     is specified).  Perforce changes that are ignored because they do
#     not have JIRA keys for the desired project are not logged.
#
#   verbose 1
#
#     All the messages from above, but logs a message indicating when a 
#     Perforce change is skipped because it does not have any JIRA keys
#     for the desired project.
#
#   verbose 2
#
#     All the messages from above, but also logs what Perforce commands
#     are being run.
#
#   verbose 3
#
#     Drinking from the fire hose.  All the messages from above, but
#     also logs:
#       + a list of the changes that were obtained from "p4 changes"
#       + the description that was obtained through "p4 changes -l"
#       + the files that were obtained through "p4 files"
#       + the text of the comment that was added to the JIRA issue
